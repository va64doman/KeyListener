To meet this specific requirement, you must:

Produce an application or website that makes use of visual drag and drop
Your code should also:

Be commented (explain the logic in your own words and include documentation comments);
Include a nested class (eg. the custom adapter inner class);
Include Logging statements to write debug/informational messages. (Take a screenshot of the Device Log showing your messages.)
Provide any "missing" element that is not covered in the group project. (eg. Navigate to a Help screen)
